                <h1>About me</h1>
                <p>My name is Ting-Fen Jhang, and I am currently studying at ntut csie. I am somewhat of a homebody, and my biggest hobby is sleeping. Besides that, I also enjoy programming, drawing, and reading novels. In the future, I hope to develop a career in the IT industry, become an engineer, and earn a good income.</p>
                <hr>
                <h1>Something</h1>
                <p>I wanted to fill up the screen, but I didn’t know what to put, so I asked ChatGPT to randomly generate a piece of text.</p>
                <br>
                <p>When Fen woke up today, the sunlight was just right, streaming onto the windowsill, and a gentle breeze swayed the curtains. She picked up a pen and started jotting down her recent thoughts, thinking about the joy of programming and the plot of the novel she read yesterday. Life felt ordinary at times, but every little thing was full of color.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Lines of code on the computer screen were neatly arranged like silent music, dancing to the rhythm of her keystrokes. She occasionally paused to take a sip of water, watching the leaves outside sway in the wind, feeling a sense of calm. The lines on her drawing paper became more detailed, the paint gradually drying, and the story slowly taking shape.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In this kind of afternoon, time seemed to slow down. Characters from novels came alive in her mind, and programming errors felt like puzzles waiting to be solved. Every thought was like exploring an unknown world, and every accomplishment brought a small sense of achievement.</p>
                <br>
                <p>As night fell and the streetlights flickered, Fen closed her notebook and prepared to sleep. Tomorrow would be another day full of possibilities.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>Fen stared at the screen, wondering if anyone would ever actually read this. Probably not. But that’s okay, because the purpose here is purely aesthetic—lines and paragraphs, a forest of words stretching endlessly, just to make the page look busy. The cat walked across her keyboard at some point, adding mysterious characters that she pretended were intentional.</p>
                <br>
                <p>She thought about coding, drawing, reading novels, and sometimes sleeping, because let’s be honest, sleep is really the main hobby. Each key she pressed felt like a tiny drumbeat in the symphony of nothing in particular. Outside, the trees swayed in the wind, completely unaware that inside, Fen was creating a wall of words that didn’t need to make sense.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Lorem thoughts collided with Ipsum ideas. Paragraphs meandered aimlessly, like someone wandering through a forest with no destination. Some sentences were complete, some half-baked, and some were just filler pretending to have meaning. If anyone tried to find a moral in this, they would be sorely disappointed.</p>
                <br>
                <p>But isn’t that the beauty of it? Random text can be soothing, like wallpaper for the mind. You don’t have to understand it. You just scroll, glance, maybe smile, and move on. Fen leaned back, proud of her masterpiece of utter randomness. Tomorrow she might write more. Or sleep. Probably sleep.</p>
